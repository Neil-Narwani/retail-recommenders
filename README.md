# Retail Recommenders
Machine Learning Project used on Specialty Retailer data for deduplication of customer records as well as using Tensorflow Recommenders to build a recommendation engine for this data.

## Phase 1
### Deduplication of Customer Data
Customer Data was presented in a CSV file.  Seeing that there were many duplicates in the customer records, we would need to deduplicate this data before using transaction data to create a recommendation engine.  

## Phase 2
### Item-Item Dataset generation
Genenerating item-item datasets to allow for a sequential model.

## Phase 3
### Tensor Flow Recommenders to create and save a Machine Learning Model on the item-item data.
